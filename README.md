# ORIDION GALAXY

A simple tool to obscure your public and private wallets.

[Oridion](https://oridion.xyz) is essentially a bunch of public PDA accounts where you can pass your funds through before arriving at your destination wallet. Once deposited, depending on the type of deposit you select, your funds will hop randomly through accounts and eventually withdraw to your destination wallet. Unlike traditional "mixers", Oridion does not depend on other users to "mix" funds. Instead, it utilizes Solana's cheap transactions to randomly hop multiple times to obscure the origins of the funds. #OnlyPossibleOnSolana
